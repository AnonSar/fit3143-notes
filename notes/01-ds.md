# Distributed Systems
A **Distributed System (DS)** is a collection of independent computers that appear to its users as a single coherent system.

There are two types of Distributed Systems:

1. **Tightly-coupled** — a network of processors that share a single memory address space
2. **Loosely-coupled** — processors with their own local memory that work together via a “communication network”

## System Models
### Minicomputer Model
* Simple extension of centralised time-sharing systems
* Few minicomputers interconnected by communication network
* Each minicomputer has multiple users logged on
* Model used for remote resource sharing between users
* e.g. ARPAnet

### Workstation Model
* Several workstations connected by communication network
* Basic idea is to share processing power
* User logs onto home workstation and submits jobs for execution, system might transfer one or more processes to other workstations
* Issues: how to find an idle workstation, how to transfer processes, what happens to a remote process, etc
* e.g. Xerox PARC, Final Cut Pro render farm

### Workstation-server Model
* Consists of few minicomputers and several workstations
* Minicomputers are used for providing services
* For higher reliability and better scalability, multiple servers may be used for a purpose
* e.g. The V-System

### Processor-pool Model
* Sometimes, user needs no computing power, but once in a while needs a very large amount for a short period of time
* “Run” server manages and allocates processors to different users
* No concept of a home machine (i.e. user logs not into one machine but to system as a whole)
* Offers better utilisation of processing power compared to other models
* e.g. Amoeba, Plan9, Cambridge DCS

### Hybrid Model
* To combine the advantages of both the Workstation-server and the Processor-pool model, a Hybrid model may be used
* It is based on the Workstation-server model but with the addition of a pool of processors
* Very expensive!

## Distribution Models
### File Model
* Resources modelled as files
* Remote resources are accessed simply by accessing files

### Remote Procedure Call Model
* Resource accesses are modelled as function calls
* Remote resources accessed by calling functions

### Distributed Object Model
* Resources are modelled as objects which are a set of data and functions to be performed on the data
* Remote resources are accessed as objects

## Advantages, Disadvantages & Challenges
### Advantages
* **Reliability** — only X% degradation if X% of machines go down (i.e. system as a whole does not go down)
* **Incremental Growth** — computing power can be added in small increments
* **Sharing** — allow many users access to a common database and peripherals
* **Communication** — makes human-to-human communication easier
* **Effective Resource Utilisation** — spread the workload over the available machines in the most cost-effective way

### Disadvantages
* **Software** — difficult to develop
* **Networking** — can saturate or cause other problems
* **Security** — easy access can also apply to secret data

### Challenges
* **Heterogeneity** — variety in networks, computer hardware, software, OS, programming languages, etc
* **Openness** — scalability and extensible can only be achieved through easy-to-use interfaces
* **Transparency** — system as a whole should look like a single computer
* **Performance** — achieving high performance out of cheap computers
* **Scalability** — system needs to work at large scales (e.g. hundreds, thousands, etc.)
* **Failure Handling** — the more parts, the more tendency to fail
* **Security** — authentication and data concealment
* **Concurrency** — programs need to run simultaneously and must not interfere with each other
